## Contributing

Edits should be made to the Markdown documents listed above. See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for guidance on syntax.
You can use the github.com interface or an app like [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) to make changes.

Anyone should feel free to make changes, by forking the repo, making the changes in your version, then creating a Pull Request to ask one of the project maintaners to merge those changes back into this repo (after they've been checked and discussed).

Please don't make changes on behalf of others, but encoueage people to request and make changes themselves. This is a living document, and as an open source project, we should strive for transparency and accountability.

## Plans

I hope we can work on a set of GitHub actions that can compile the document into HTML and then to PDF when we make releases, so there's always a downloadable version, but not something we have to manually put together.
